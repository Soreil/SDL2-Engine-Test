# SDL2-Engine-Test

A currently WIP structure for my future game. The engine takes advantage of some usefull C++11 features like templating and range based for loops. 
currently compiles on gcc 6.1.0+ using C++14 flag

As this project approaches a playable alpha, engine code will (hopefully) be seperated from game logic to where I can offer a look under the hood, without giving away the whole game
