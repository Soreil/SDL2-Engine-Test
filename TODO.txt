- Test if DT will provide smooth movement (SOLVED)

- Figure out movement issue [-]
  -- It's an issue with DT calculation, OF COURSE


- Implement other states [-] (Implemented a playing state)



- Implement a timer class (which will help fix DT issues)

- Test collisions implementation

- In game states? (Sub-states inside PlayingState)

- Maybe do some drawing up of the shops
