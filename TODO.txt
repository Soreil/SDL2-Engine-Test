- Figure out movement issue [-]
  -- It's an issue with DT calculation, OF COURSE

- Implement other states [x] (Solved for now, I Implemented a playing state which will be enough.)

- Implement a timer class ( Timer is implemented, seems to be working)

  >>>YOU ARE HERE

- Test collisions implementation
  -- To do this, I will need a test entity, maybe start on walls?
  


Best way to go about this is to have entityManager, with three stacks;

one stack for important entities,
one for less important entities (NPCs),
one for static objects (Walls, ect.)

Maps will be their own class, and contain mostly data

Map will be passed to an entity manager for a spawnMapEntities(Map* map) function

entityManager will do broad phase / narrow phase checks (player against all colliders / players around near col.) 


- In game states? (Sub-states inside PlayingState)

- Maybe do some drawing up of the shops
